      <p>I have been a developer at Fiserv since 2021.</p>
      <p>
        I had the unquie oppurtunity of being apart of a two year rotational
        program that allowed me to experience different areas of software
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first rotation was with the AI and ML team. Working on IVR's,
        chatbot utilizing IBM Watson, and later large language models such as
        GPT 3.5 Turbo. Here we used C# within .NET CORE.
      </p>

      <p>
        My second rotation was with a web development team. Specifically working
        with Javascript within React.js.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Portfolio was programmed from the ground up using React.js and
        hosted on Google Firebase. The source code can be viewed in my Github.
      </p>
